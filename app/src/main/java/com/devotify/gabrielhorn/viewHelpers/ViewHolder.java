 *         This class should be subclassed when using custom row layouts for list views. Using a view holder significantly optimizes list view
 *         loading because {@link #findViewById()} is not called for each row in the layout after initialization has been completed. Elements in the list view
 *         are stored in a hashmap, where an int is the id of the requested UI element within the row and also functions as a key that returns the
 *         cached view.
